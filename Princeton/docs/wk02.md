# week 2

- Premature optimization may be harmful
  - think carefully about your high-level algorithm first
  - write the clearest code that implements your algorithm directly
  - use the scientific method
    - measure performance and optimize if and where necessary

SEQEQ: Substitution of Equals for Equals

```hs
openWindow   :: Title -> Size -> IO Window
closeWindow  :: Window -> IO ()
drawInWindow :: Window -> Graphic -> IO ()
runGraphics  :: IO () -> IO ()
text         :: Point -> String -> Graphic
getKey       :: Window -> IO Char
```

the types are descriptive!

folding/unfolding of Haskell definitions (abstraction)

- unfold function abstractions
- push symbolic names around like we do in mathematical proofs
- reason locally using properties of operations (eg: + commutes)
- use induction hypothesis
- fold function abstractions back up

Can we define foldr in terms of map?

- No. How do we prove it?
- A formal theorem might say:
  - for all b, f, xs, there exists g, ys such that `foldr b f xs == map g ys`
- To disprove that theorem, find a counter-example. Consider:
  - `length xs = foldr 0 (1+) xs`
- Does there exist a g and ys such that
  - `fold 0 (1+) xs == map g ys` ?
- Consider the types:
  - `fold 0 (1+) xs :: Int`
  - `map g ys :: [b]`
