## ad hoc polymorphism

Ad hoc polymorphism. (2022, June 13). In Wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc_polymorphism

通过 typeclass 来完成

[example](/example/json/README.md)

> This is in contrast to parametric polymorphism, in which polymorphic functions are written without mention of any specific type, and can thus apply a single abstract implementation to any number of types in a transparent way.

不同于泛型, 根本不涉及类型

## induction on the structure of the type

- Given: `instance (T a) => T (Constructor a) where ...`
- Assume: the axioms for `T` hold for type `a`
- Must prove: the axioms hold for type `Constructor a`
- the axioms at the smaller type a are used as inductive hypotheses within the proofs of the axioms for `Constructor a`
- If all your type classes have the form
  - `instance (T a) => T (Constructor a) where ...`
  - then your type class is uninhabited! You need some base cases.
- Base cases arise when types unconditionally belong to the type class

`type Pair a b`是`EQ`, 只需要递归地`a`和`b`是`EQ`

## functional programming

the principles of functional programming

- defining new functions: functional abstraction for code reuse
- defining new types: type abstraction
- higher-order programming: using functions as data
- the same algorithm over different data: parametric polymorphism
- related operations over different types: ad hoc polymorphism via type classes

## domain-specific languages
