### Reference material

- [The Haskell Hierarchical Libraries reference](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/index.html) provides the documentation for the standard library that comes with your compiler. This is one of the most valuable online assets for Haskell programmers.
- For questions about language syntax and features, the [Haskell 98 Report](http://haskell.org/onlinereport/) describes the Haskell 98 language standard.
- Various extensions to the language have become commonplace since the Haskell 98 Report was released. The [GHC Users's Guide](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/index.html) contains detailed documentation on the extensions supported by GHC, as well as some GHC-specific features.
- [Hoogle](http://haskell.org/hoogle/) and [Hayoo](http://holumbus.fh-wedel.de/hayoo/hayoo.html) are Haskell API search engines. They can search for functions by name or by type.

### Applications and libraries

If you're looking for a Haskell library to use for a particular task, or an application written in Haskell, check out the following resources.

- The Haskell community maintains a central repository of open source Haskell libraries and applications. It's called [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/), and it lets you search for software to download, or browse its collection by category.
- The [Haskell Wiki](http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Applications_and_libraries) contains a section dedicated to information about particular Haskell libraries.

### The Haskell community

There are a number of ways you can get in touch with other Haskell programmers, to ask questions, learn what other people are talking about, and simply do some social networking with your peers.

- The first stop on your search for community resources should be the [Haskell web site](http://www.haskell.org/). This page contains the most current links to various communities and information, as well as a huge and actively maintained wiki.
- Haskellers use a number of [mailing lists](http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Mailing_lists) for topical discussions. Of these, the most generally interesting is named `haskell-cafe`. It has a relaxed, friendly atmosphere, where professionals and academics rub shoulders with casual hackers and beginners.
- For real-time chat, the [Haskell IRC channel](http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/IRC_channel), named `#haskell`, is large and lively. Like `haskell-cafe`, the atmosphere stays friendly and helpful in spite of the huge number of concurrent users.
- There are many local user groups, meetups, academic workshops, and the like; here is [a list of the known user groups and workshops](http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/User_groups).
- The [Haskell Weekly News](http://sequence.complete.org/) is a very-nearly-weekly summary of activities in the Haskell community. You can find pointers to interesting mailing list discussions, new software releases, and the like.
- The [Haskell Communities and Activities Report](http://haskell.org/communities/) collects information about people that use Haskell, and what they are doing with it. It has been running for years, so it provides a good way to peer into Haskell's past.
