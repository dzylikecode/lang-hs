## target

- 深入, pure 函数式编程

## concept

- referential transparency

  if a function is called twice with the same parameters, it's guaranteed to return the same result. That's called referential transparency and not only does it allow the compiler to reason about the program's behavior, but it also allows you to easily deduce (and even prove) that a function is correct and then build more complex functions by gluing simple functions together.

  think of programs as a series of transformations on data
