We defer every computation until its result is actually needed: Haskell is a lazy language. Laziness is not merely a matter of moving work around: it profoundly affects how we write programs.

It's important to recognise that each of these approaches involves tradeoffs. Very briefly put, the Haskell perspective emphasises safety, while the dynamically typed outlook favours flexibility.
