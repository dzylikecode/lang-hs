We defer every computation until its result is actually needed: Haskell is a lazy language. Laziness is not merely a matter of moving work around: it profoundly affects how we write programs.

It's important to recognise that each of these approaches involves tradeoffs. Very briefly put, the Haskell perspective emphasises safety, while the dynamically typed outlook favours flexibility.

类型似乎是一种限制, 相对于 js, py 的 any, 然后事实上 js, py 相当于把所有的东西都限制为一种类型 any

Haskell 在不断用函数丰富自己的词汇

距离 quickSort

首先, 自己调用自己

然后是, 使用 list comphrehension

最后有了 partition 词汇
