## abstract

- The behaviors documenting the use of your library should be written with [doctest](https://github.com/sol/doctest-haskell#readme)
- The behaviors documenting functionality rather than usage of your library should be written with [hspec](http://hspec.github.com/)
- Cabal is used to automate testing with the frameworks
- For pure code, QuickCheck property test cases (with doctest and/or hspec) should be written as much as possible
